# Exploration of RAG Chatbot Architecture with AWS Bedrock and Kendra

This project serves as a hands-on exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot architecture using **Amazon Bedrock**, **Kendra**, and **Python**. It was developed as a proof of concept (POC) to deepen understanding of AWS's managed AI and knowledge base services.

## About The Project

This project was inspired by the need to evaluate the feasibility of implementing RAG-based chatbot solutions in corporate environments. Following the AWS workshop on RAG architecture, this POC showcases how **Amazon Bedrock** and **Kendra** can integrate with custom data sources for efficient and cost-effective AI solutions.

### Objectives
- **Familiarize with AWS Services**: Explore **Amazon Bedrock** for generative AI and **Kendra** for knowledge base retrieval.
- **Understand RAG Workflow**: Investigate how RAG architecture combines generative AI with relevant, real-time knowledge retrieval.
- **Evaluate Practicality**: Assess the cost-benefit and feasibility of using this architecture in enterprise environments.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Strengthen knowledge of AWS AI solutions and Python-based implementations.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to explore this architecture yourself, AWS provides a detailed walkthrough for setting up the environment and deploying the architecture. You can find the full instructions here: [AWS Workshop - RAG Chatbot Architecture](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/27eb3134-4f33-4689-bb73-269e4273947a/en-US).

### Requirements
- AWS Account with permissions for Bedrock, Kendra, and Lambda.
- Python 3.x environment for running scripts and testing integrations.
- Familiarity with AWS CLI and SDKs.

## Skills and Insights Gained

This project provided valuable hands-on experience with:
- **Generative AI**: Understanding how Amazon Bedrock enables large language models (LLMs) to generate conversational responses.
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Using Amazon Kendra for intelligent, domain-specific search from structured and unstructured data.
- **AI Workflow Integration**: Building Python scripts to orchestrate AI workflows across AWS services.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Evaluating the financial and technical viability of implementing RAG architecture in corporate environments.
