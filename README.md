## About The Project

This project is an exploration of generative AI chatbot architecture using Amazon Bedrock and Kendra. I'm looking to implement something similar at a bigger scale and decided to follow along with the AWS cloud workshop as a first dive into these managed services.

My specific objectives in this project:
* To familiarize with Amazon Bedrock and Kendra
* To explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with custom data sources
* To analyze cost-benefit for this architecture
* To determine feasability of implementation in the corporate environment
